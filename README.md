**Live ETL Dashboard** is a Python-based interactive dashboard built with Streamlit and Plotly that allows users to upload CSV/JSON files or provide API URLs, runs an automated ETL (Extract → Transform → Load) pipeline on the data, and displays real-time metrics, charts, and tables.  
Users can filter data by categories, numeric ranges, and dates, download filtered datasets as CSV, export charts as PNG, and generate PDF reports.  
The dashboard auto-refreshes every 10 seconds and provides an end-to-end solution for visualizing and reporting data efficiently.
